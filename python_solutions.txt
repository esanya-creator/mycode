1)Python Program to Reverse a Given Number
n=int(input("Enter number: "))
rev=0
while(n>0):
    dig=n%10
    rev=rev*10+dig
    n=n//10
print("Reverse of the number:",rev)

2)Python Program to Accept Three Digits and Print all Possible Combinations from the Digits
Problem Solution
1.	Take in the first, second and third number and store it in separate variables.
2.	Then append all the three numbers to the list.
3.	Use three for loops and print the digits in the list if none of their indexes are equal to each other.
4.	Exit.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of the Python Program to accept three distinct digits and prints all possible combinations from the digits. The program output is also shown below.

 
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
c=int(input("Enter third number:"))
d=[]
d.append(a)
d.append(b)
d.append(c)
for i in range(0,3):
    for j in range(0,3):
        for k in range(0,3):
            if(i!=j&j!=k&k!=i):
                print(d[i],d[j],d[k])
Program Explanation
1.	User must enter the first, second and third number.
2.	All the elements are appending into a list for the ease of comparison.
3.	The for loops range from 0-2 which are basically the indexes of the three elements in the list.
4.	If none of the indexes are equal to each other, the element associated with the particular element in the list is printed.

Runtime Test Cases
 
Case 1:
Enter first number:1
Enter second number:2
Enter third number:3
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
3 2 1

3)Python Program to Calculate the Number of Digits and Letters in a String.
Problem Solution
1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable.
2. Initialize the two count variables to 0.
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a character is encountered.
4. Print the total count of both the variables.
5. Exit.

string=raw_input("Enter string:")
count1=0
count2=0
for i in string:
      if(i.isdigit()):
            count1=count1+1
      count2=count2+1
print("The number of digits is:")
print(count1)
print("The number of characters is:")
print(count2)

Runtime Test Cases
 
Case 1:
Enter string:Hello123
The number of digits is:
3
The number of characters is:
8

Python Program to Check if a Given Key Exists in a Dictionary or Not

d={'A':1,'B':2,'C':3}
key=raw_input("Enter key to check:")
if key in d.keys():
      print("Key is present and value of the key is:")
      print(d[key])
else:
      print("Key isn't present!")
	  
Case 1:
Enter key to check:A
Key is present and value of the key is:
1
 
Case 2:
Enter key to check:F
Key isn't present!

Python Program to Count the Occurrences of Each Word in a Given String Sentence

string=raw_input("Enter string:")
word=raw_input("Enter word:")
a=[]
count=0
a=string.split(" ")
for i in range(0,len(a)):
      if(word==a[i]):
            count=count+1
print("Count of the word is:")
print(count)

Case 1:
Enter string:hello world
Enter word:hello
Count of the word is:
1

Python Program to Count the Number of Words in a Text File

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
 
num_words = 0
 
with open(fname, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        words = line.split()
        num_words += len(words)
print("Number of words:")
print(num_words)

Program Explanation
1. User must enter a file name.
2. The file is opened using the open() function in the read mode.
3. A for loop is used to read through each line in the file.
4. Each line is split into a list of words using split().
5. The number of words in each line is counted using len() and the count variable is incremented.
6. The number of words in the file is printed.

Runtime Test Cases
 
Case 1:
Contents of file: 
Hello world
 
Output: 
Enter file name: data1.txt
Number of words:
2

2) What are the built-in type does python provides?

There are mutable and Immutable types of Pythons built in types Mutable built-in types

List
Sets
Dictionaries
Immutable built-in types

Strings
Tuples
Numbers

3) What is lambda in Python?
It is a single expression anonymous function often used as inline function.

4)What is module and package in Python?

In Python, module is the way to structure program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other modules like objects and attributes.

The folder of Python program is a package of modules. A package can have modules or subfolders.

5)Explain how to delete a file in Python?
By using a command os.remove (filename) or os.unlink(filename)

6)Mention the use of the split function in Python?

The use of the split function in Python is that it breaks a string into shorter strings using the defined separator. It gives a list of all words present in the string.
