Variable:
reserved memory location to store value

Do we neeed to declare variable before using it?
no need to declare the variable, We can declare as in needed.

Data types:

It is clasification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical,relation or logical operations can be applied to it 

6 types:

Numeric:It is used to store number(integer,Float,Complex,Long Type(no longer supports))

can we convert complex to Int (complex to float) (intrepret confuses which needs to be converted real or imaginary)

List
It is most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma separated values between square brackets.


Tuple
It is sequence datatype similar list.enclosed with parathesis. list elements can change.
tuple canot be updated.
It is sequence of immutable python objects.Tuples are readonly datatypes.

Strings:
A string is a sequence of characters.We can create Strings by enclosing characters in quotes

Set:
It is an unordered collections of uniques items.
Set is defined by values separated by comma inside brace()

Dictonary:
It is unordered collections of key value pairs.


Prime numbers till 100

i=2
while(i<100):
    j = 2
	while (j <= (i/j)):
	    if not (i%j): break
		j=j+1
	if(j>i/j):print(i,'is prime)
	i=i+1

It’s handy when you have two related operations which you’d like to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between. The classic example is opening a file, manipulating the file, then closing it:

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML, pronounced sam-el[1]) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. As its name implies, SAML is an XML-based markup language for security assertions (statements that service providers use to make access-control decisions). SAML is also:
